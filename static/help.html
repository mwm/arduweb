  <h1>Quick help for Bulls and Cows</h1>

  <body>
    <p>This is a trivial SMS-based implementation of the classic game
    <i>Bulls and Cows</i> (or <i>Cows and Bulls</i> or
    <i>MasterMind</i>).</p>
    
    <p>The computer has chosen a string of four digits. The digits are
    drawn from '0' to '9', inclusive. Each digit can only occur once
    in the computers guess. Your job is to guess what the four digits
    are.</p>
    
    <p>On your part, a move consists of texting a guess - a sequence
    of 4 unique digits - to (405) 283-6344. If the move doesn't have 4
    unique digits, it's invalid. When the guess matches the chosen
    string, you win.</p>
    
    <p>In return, you'll get back a text telling you that the move was
    invalid (if it was), or that you won and in how many moves, and
    the move number along with how many bulls and cows you have. A
    bull represents the correct digit in the correct place in the
    number, a cow a correct digit but not in the correct place.</p>
    
    <p>Simple, right? Any game can be solved in seven turns. Good
    luck.</p>
    
    <p>At this point, this is very much a test implementation. Please
    be gentle with it, and report problems to <a
    href="mailto:mwm@mired.org">me.</a></p>
